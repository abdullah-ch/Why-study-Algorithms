# Why-study-Algorithms
In the cpp files, there are two algorithms, one with recursion and another one with a loop.
It is important to note that for the recusion algorithm inorder to compute 100th fibonacci number, it would take
approximately 586,000 years for a computer of 1 GHZ processor. We cannot wait for 56000 YEARS ,RIGHT !!!...
So, the other algorithm with the loop will execute in mere seconds...So it is important to study algorithms so that you can save 
huge amount of TIME.............
